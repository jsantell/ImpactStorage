# ImpactStorage - Local Storage plugin for ImpactJS #

ImpactStorage is a plugin for HTML5/js game framework [ImpactJS](http://www.impactjs.com), giving developers an easy-to-use interface to localStorage for their projects. Mostly a facade for localStorage, ImpactStorage is set up to bake with your ImpactJS project, take care of some error handling, some convenience methods, as well as support objects in addition to strings.

Created by [Jordan Santell](http://www.jsantell.com) for [Duck It!](http://www.spacewhalestudios.com/duckit/) (oh god, I need to finish this); enjoy!

# Change Log

## 1.01
* Cleaned up a lot of redundant syntax
* Methods return ``null`` if the browser doesn't support localStorage -- ``isCapable()`` should still be used
* Added a minified version

# Installation

* Move impact-storage.js to your ImpactJS project's plugin folder: ``[PROJECT]/lib/plugins/impact-storage.js``
* Add the plugin to your main.js file
<pre>
    ig.module(
        'game.main'
    )
    .requires(
        'impact-game',
        ...
        'plugins.impact-storage',
        ...
    )
</pre>
* Create a local storage object and check out the examples and methods below
<pre>
    storage: new ig.Storage(),
</pre>


# Methods

* ``isCapable()``: Returns ``true`` if the browser is capable of using localStorage. ``false`` otherwise.
* ``isSet(key)``: Returns ``true`` if ``key`` has been set in localStorage. ``false`` otherwise.
* ``initUnset(key, value)``: *Iff* ``key`` has not been set, set ``key`` to ``value``
* ``get(key)``: Returns the value associated with ``key`` in localStorage as a ``string``, or an ``object`` if parsable by JSON.
* ``getInt(key)``: Returns the value associated with ``key`` in localStorage as an ``int``.
* ``getFloat(key)``: Returns the value associated with ``key`` in localStorage as a ``float``.
* ``getBool(key)``: Returns the value associated with ``key`` in localStorage as a ``bool``. Returns ``null`` if ``value`` is not ``0``, ``1``, ``false`` or ``true``.
* ``key(n)``: Returns the value of the key stored at position ``n`` in localStorage.
* ``set(key, value)``: Sets an item in localStorage with the ``key`` ``value`` pair. Overwrites the previous value of ``key`` if it existed previously. ``value`` is stored as either a ``string`` or an ``object``.
* ``setHighest(key, value)``: Sets an item in localStorage with the ``key`` ``value`` pair *iff* the currently stored ``value`` is smaller, then returns true. Otherwise returns false.
* ``remove(key)``: Removes the item with the specified ``key``.
* ``clear()``: Clears all localStorage data associated with this origin.


# Examples

## High Score

<pre>
    this.storage = new ig.Storage();

    // Initialize high score as 0 if 'highScore' does not exist
    this.storage.initUnset('highScore', 0);
</pre>
During the update loop that determines whether or not the current score should override the score in localStorage:
<pre>
    var player = this.getEntitiesByType(EntityPlayer)[0];
    /*
       Updates the value of 'highScore' if and only
       if player.score > this.storage.get('highScore')
    */
    this.storage.setHighest('highScore',player.score);
</pre>

## Storing JSON Objects

localStorage stores all data as strings, but the ImpactStorage ``.set(key, value)`` and ``.get(key)`` methods convert objects to and from strings  in order to be saved to localStorage.
<pre>

    this.storage = new ig.Storage();
    /*
       Player's velocity is an object stored as
       vel: {x: 200, y: 100}
       And that data is now being stored with key playerVel in localStorage
    */
    var player = this.getEntitiesByType(EntityPlayer)[0];
    this.storage.set('playerVel',player.vel)

    // And let's output it for fun
    alert("Player's x velocity: "+this.storage.get('playerVel').x);
    alert("Player's y velocity: "+this.storage.get('playerVel').y);

</pre>
